# SAPPHIRE

Pokémon Sapphire ROM modification project.

## External-event permanence

The target is **not only Eon Ticket**. Ruby/Sapphire external content is being converted so it can be accessed locally without the original e-Reader/distribution transport.

Current base patch:

- MYSTERY EVENT main-menu entry is always enabled for a valid save.
- Lilycove Harbor no longer requires the physical EON TICKET item.
- Harbor and Southern Island no longer depend on `FLAG_SYS_HAS_EON_TICKET`.
- Normal story progression and one-time Latias/Latios encounter completion are preserved.
- Signature-based detection is validated against 12 Japanese/English/German/French/Italian/Spanish Sapphire ROM revisions.
- No ROM image is stored in this repository.

Full card catalog:

- 114 Battle-e Trainer cards
- 12 e-Card Berry cards
- 1 Decoration Present card, containing three Regi Doll choices
- 1 Eon Ticket card

The original engine only stores one Battle-e trainer and one e-Reader Berry at a time. Therefore full permanence requires an internal ROM catalog/loader rather than merely forcing flags. See `docs/EXTERNAL_EVENTS.md`.

## Tools

`tools/sapphire_external_events.py`

```sh
python tools/sapphire_external_events.py analyze sapphire.gba
python tools/sapphire_external_events.py patch sapphire.gba sapphire.external-events.gba
```

The tool rejects unknown ROM hashes by default.

## Reference order

Japanese/original material is the primary reference. Korean is next where official material exists, then English, followed by other official languages.
